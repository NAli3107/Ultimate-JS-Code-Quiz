# Ultimate-JS-Code-Quiz

Overview:

This web application is quiz that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

Functionality:

When the user clicks the start button, a timer starts and the user is presented with the first question. When they answer this question, then they are presented with another question. However, if the user answers a question incorrectly then time is subtracted from the clock - specifically 10 seconds. Once all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, then the game is over. 

The user is then redirected to a page which informs them of their score and a form where they can input their initials. After this, they can submit their their information and their initials plus their score will be saved in local storage. Once they select submit, they will be redirected to a high scores page that will render the latest high scores.

What to Expect:
